Our code is a list program, which means it creates a list that users can interact with. Once you open and start the code if students had a tutorial function
you will be asked "Would you like a tutorial?" and if you answer yes it'll give you a breakdown of what the code is and how to use it. If there isn't a tutorial 
you would want to run the program first, then you need to type an integer that relates with one of the 10 options you'll see. If you choose option 1 you can add 
items to your list. Option 2 will add a lot of numbers to your list.
