Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

In 9th grade I learned the python coding language last year and the basic concepts of coding. I also learned some statements of coding which are assingment statements, conditional statements, and looping statements. 



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


In my 10th grade year I learned what binary code was and psuedo code. Binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system and pseudocode is a "text-based" detail design tool. I also learned to create discord bots that can protect users and interact with them on a server level. 




What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?


I'd like to improve on being abe to explain my code and what its able to do. 


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?


The part that challenges me is when we create a program that needs to do a certain thing like when we made the dice rolling program or the card deck program. 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.


I want to be able to create my own program thats able to talk to the user, I also want it to be able to play games with the user. Something simple like chess or Uno.
